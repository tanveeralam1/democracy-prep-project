# Democracy Prep Project
Tanveer Alam


Hello, Welcome to the Project

This project addresses Task 2.

It utiizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Scripts, and Google Sheets.

Please note Bootstrap, a template for HTML/CSS was used, as well as (https://github.com/jamiewilson) documentation to configure the code for Google Scripts, and Google Sheets.
That code allows the form/survey to enter it's data into a Google Sheet.

Here's how to view the project:

Click or Go to this URL: https://tanveeralam1.github.io/democracy-prep-project/

Parents will fill out this survey, some "users" have already been registered into this system. Please feel free to fill out the form and add additional "responses".
Note the "No more than 1 survey response is logged per family without requiring a logging" was not setup due to time constraints.

After viewing this survey page, you will also see a link called "Private Page"
Note: At the current time, this was not a private page due to time constraints.

Viewing this Private Page, gives access to the survey data Google Sheets, as well as pre-set dynamic pie charts that allow for visual data representation and will adjust as more responses are added.


Please contact me for futher questions or if anything is unclear.
